# React Hooks Overview

React hooks allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. Here are some of the most commonly used hooks with examples and potential interview questions.

### 1. useState

**Purpose**: Manages state in functional components.

**Example**:
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Questions**:
- How do you use the `useState` hook?
- What are the arguments and return values of `useState`?
- Can you explain the difference between using `useState` and `this.state` in class components?

### 2. useEffect

**Purpose**: Performs side effects in functional components.

**Example**:
```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function Timer() {
  const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setSeconds(prevSeconds => prevSeconds + 1);
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  return <div>Seconds: {seconds}</div>;
}
```

**Questions**:
- How does the `useEffect` hook work?
- What are some common use cases for `useEffect`?
- How do you clean up side effects in `useEffect`?

### 3. useContext

**Purpose**: Consumes context values in functional components.

**Example**:
```javascript
import React, { useContext } from 'react';

const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

function ThemedButton() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);

  return <button className={theme}>I am styled by theme context!</button>;
}
```

**Questions**:
- What is the `useContext` hook and how do you use it?
- How does `useContext` compare to the Context API in class components?
- Can you provide an example where `useContext` is useful?

### 4. useReducer

**Purpose**: Manages complex state logic.

**Example**:
```javascript
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

const initialState = { count: 0 };

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'decrement':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'increment' })}>+</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'decrement' })}>-</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Questions**:
- What is the `useReducer` hook and how is it different from `useState`?
- When would you use `useReducer` instead of `useState`?
- How do you structure a reducer function?

### 5. useMemo

**Purpose**: Memoizes expensive calculations.

**Example**:
```javascript
import React, { useMemo, useState } from 'react';

function ExpensiveCalculationComponent({ num }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const expensiveCalculation = useMemo(() => {
    console.log('Calculating...');
    return num * 2;
  }, [num]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Result: {expensiveCalculation}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Re-render</button>
      <p>Re-rendered {count} times</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Questions**:
- What is the purpose of `useMemo`?
- How does `useMemo` help with performance optimization?
- What is the difference between `useMemo` and `useCallback`?

### 6. useCallback

**Purpose**: Memoizes callback functions.

**Example**:
```javascript
import React, { useCallback, useState } from 'react';

function CallbackComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [text, setText] = useState('');

  const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
    console.log(`Count: ${count}`);
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment count</button>
      <button onClick={memoizedCallback}>Log count</button>
      <input value={text} onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Questions**:
- What is the `useCallback` hook used for?
- How do `useCallback` and `useMemo` differ in their use cases?
- Can you provide a scenario where `useCallback` would be beneficial?

### 7. Custom Hooks

**Purpose**: Encapsulates reusable logic.

**Example**:
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function useFetch(url) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(url)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => {
        setData(data);
        setLoading(false);
      });
  }, [url]);

  return { data, loading };
}

function DataFetchingComponent() {
  const { data, loading } = useFetch('https://api.example.com/data');

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return <div>Data: {JSON.stringify(data)}</div>;
}
```

**Questions**:

Preparing these concepts and practicing coding examples will help you perform well in a React interview focused on hooks.

# context vs context api with examples 

In React, "context" generally refers to a way of passing data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. The Context API is the official mechanism provided by React for this purpose. Here, I'll explain both and provide examples to illustrate their usage.

### React Context

React Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree. 

**Basic Steps for Using Context:**

1. **Create Context**: Use `React.createContext` to create a context object.
2. **Provide Context**: Use a Provider component to wrap the part of the tree that needs access to the context.
3. **Consume Context**: Use the context value in the components that need it.

**Example:**

```javascript
import React, { createContext, useContext } from 'react';

// Step 1: Create Context
const ThemeContext = createContext('light');

function App() {
  return (
    // Step 2: Provide Context
    <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
      <Toolbar />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

function Toolbar() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ThemedButton />
    </div>
  );
}

function ThemedButton() {
  // Step 3: Consume Context
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return <button className={theme}>I am styled by theme context!</button>;
}

export default App;
```

In this example, `ThemeContext` is created with a default value of `'light'`. The `App` component provides a `value` of `'dark'` for the context, and `ThemedButton` consumes that value using the `useContext` hook.

### Context API

The Context API refers to the entire process of creating, providing, and consuming context in a React application. It includes the use of `React.createContext`, the Provider, and the Consumer (or `useContext` hook) components.

**Detailed Example Using the Context API:**

```javascript
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';

// Create a Context with a default value
const AuthContext = createContext(null);

function App() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: 'John Doe' });

  return (
    // Provide the context to the subtree
    <AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, setUser }}>
      <Profile />
      <Login />
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
}

function Profile() {
  // Consume the context value
  const { user } = useContext(AuthContext);
  return <div>User: {user ? user.name : 'Not logged in'}</div>;
}

function Login() {
  const { setUser } = useContext(AuthContext);

  const login = () => {
    // Update the context value
    setUser({ name: 'Jane Doe' });
  };

  return <button onClick={login}>Log in as Jane Doe</button>;
}

export default App;
```

In this example:

1. **Create Context**: `AuthContext` is created with `createContext`.
2. **Provide Context**: The `App` component uses `AuthContext.Provider` to provide the `user` state and `setUser` function to the entire subtree.
3. **Consume Context**: The `Profile` and `Login` components consume the context using the `useContext` hook. `Profile` displays the user name, and `Login` updates the user state when the button is clicked.

### Comparison

- **Context**: Refers to the concept of sharing state or data across components without passing props through every level of the component tree.
- **Context API**: The official API provided by React to implement the context concept. It includes `createContext`, `Provider`, `Consumer`, and the `useContext` hook.

**Summary**:

- **Context** is the concept or idea of sharing data.
- **Context API** is the set of tools provided by React to implement this concept in a standardized way.

Both examples above demonstrate how to use context and the Context API to share and consume data in a React application.

# context vs context api

"Context" and "Context API" are related concepts in React, and it's important to understand their distinctions:

### Context:

1. **Definition:**
   - **Context** in React refers to the way data can be passed down the component tree without manually passing props at each level. It provides a way to share values like themes, authentication status, or other global data between components.

2. **How it Works:**
   - A **provider** component is defined at a higher level in the component tree, wrapping the subtree where you want to make the context available.
   - Components within the subtree can then **consume** this context using the `useContext` hook or `Context.Consumer` component.

3. **Example (without Context API):**
   ```jsx
   // Without Context API
   const ThemeProvider = ({ children, theme }) => (
     <div style={{ color: theme.text }}>{children}</div>
   );

   const ThemedComponent = ({ children }) => (
     <ThemeProvider theme={{ text: 'blue' }}>
       {children}
     </ThemeProvider>
   );

   // ThemedComponent can access the 'theme' without direct prop passing
   ```

### Context API:

1. **Definition:**
   - The **Context API** in React is an official API that simplifies the process of creating and managing context in a React application.

2. **`createContext` Function:**
   - The key part of the Context API is the `createContext` function. It returns a `Provider` and a `Consumer` component that can be used to create a context.

3. **`useContext` Hook:**
   - The `useContext` hook is a part of the Context API. It allows functional components to subscribe to a context without introducing a wrapping component.

4. **Example (with Context API):**
   ```jsx
   // With Context API
   import React, { createContext, useContext } from 'react';

   const ThemeContext = createContext({ text: 'blue' });

   const ThemedComponent = ({ children }) => {
     const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
     return <div style={{ color: theme.text }}>{children}</div>;
   };

   const App = () => (
     <ThemeContext.Provider value={{ text: 'green' }}>
       <ThemedComponent>Hello, World!</ThemedComponent>
     </ThemeContext.Provider>
   );
   ```

### Key Differences:

- **Built-in API:**
  - **Context API** is a built-in feature provided by React, offering a more standardized and convenient way to create and manage context compared to rolling your own solution.

- **Hook Support:**
  - **`useContext`** is a hook introduced by the Context API, providing a cleaner syntax for consuming context within functional components.

- **TypeScript Support:**
  - **Context API** includes TypeScript support, making it easier to use with statically typed languages.

- **Widespread Adoption:**
  - Over time, the **Context API** has become the de facto standard for managing state at a global level in React applications.

In summary, while "context" is a general concept of passing data down the component tree, the "Context API" is a specific implementation provided by React to make the process more structured, efficient, and user-friendly. If you need to manage global state or share data between components in a React application, the Context API is often the recommended approach.
